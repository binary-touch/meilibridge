### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through these issues:

- [Good first issues](https://github.com/binary-touch/meilibridge/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/binary-touch/meilibridge/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which need extra attention

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- Docker and Docker Compose (for running dependencies)
- Git

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/meilibridge.git
   cd meilibridge
   ```

2. **Install Rust dependencies**
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Start development dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Start PostgreSQL, Meilisearch, and Redis
   make docker-up
   
   # Or using docker-compose directly
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

4. **Copy the example configuration**
   ```bash
   cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
   ```

5. **Run the tests**
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

6. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

### Useful Make Commands

```bash
make help          # Show all available commands
make build         # Build the project
make test          # Run all tests
make fmt           # Format code
make lint          # Run clippy linter
make docker-up     # Start development dependencies
make docker-down   # Stop development dependencies
make clean         # Clean build artifacts
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, idiomatic Rust code
- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run unit tests
cargo test

# Run integration tests
cargo test --test '*' -- --test-threads=1

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# Run with logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test

# Check for common mistakes
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Format your code
cargo fmt
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
# Features
git commit -m "feat: add support for MySQL source adapter"

# Bug fixes
git commit -m "fix: handle connection timeout in CDC reader"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs: update configuration examples"

# Performance improvements
git commit -m "perf: optimize batch processing for large datasets"

# Tests
git commit -m "test: add integration tests for checkpoint recovery"

# Refactoring
git commit -m "refactor: extract common retry logic to utils"
```

### 5. Push and Create a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:
- Clear title following conventional commits
- Description of what changed and why
- Link to related issue(s)
- Screenshots/logs if applicable

## Style Guidelines

### Rust Code Style

- Use `cargo fmt` to format code
- Use `cargo clippy` to catch common mistakes
- Follow [Rust naming conventions](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/naming.html)
- Write descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use `Result<T, Error>` for error handling
- Prefer `&str` over `String` for function parameters
- Use `Arc<RwLock<T>>` for shared mutable state

### Example Code Style

```rust
use crate::error::{MeiliBridgeError, Result};
use std::sync::Arc;
use tokio::sync::RwLock;

/// Processes events from the source adapter
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `events` - Vector of events to process
/// * `config` - Processing configuration
/// 
/// # Returns
/// * `Result<ProcessedBatch>` - Processed events or error
pub async fn process_events(
    events: Vec<Event>,
    config: &ProcessConfig,
) -> Result<ProcessedBatch> {
    // Validate input
    if events.is_empty() {
        return Err(MeiliBridgeError::Validation(
            "No events to process".to_string()
        ));
    }
    
    // Process events
    let processed = events
        .into_iter()
        .filter(|e| should_process(e, config))
        .map(|e| transform_event(e, config))
        .collect::<Result<Vec<_>>>()?;
    
    Ok(ProcessedBatch::new(processed))
}
```

### Documentation Style

- Add module-level documentation
- Document public APIs with examples
- Use markdown formatting in doc comments
- Include error conditions in documentation

```rust
//! Event processing module
//! 
//! This module handles the transformation and filtering of CDC events
//! before they are sent to the destination.

/// Transforms an event according to the configuration
/// 
/// # Example
/// ```rust
/// let event = Event::Insert { 
///     table: "users".to_string(),
///     data: json!({"id": 1, "name": "Alice"})
/// };
/// let transformed = transform_event(event, &config)?;
/// ```
/// 
/// # Errors
/// Returns `MeiliBridgeError::Transform` if transformation fails
pub fn transform_event(event: Event, config: &Config) -> Result<Event> {
    // Implementation
}
```

## Testing

### Test Organization

```
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit/           # Unit tests for individual components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/    # Integration tests with real dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ common/         # Shared test utilities
```

### Writing Tests

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn test_event_filter() {
        let filter = EventFilter::new(config);
        let event = create_test_event();
        
        assert!(filter.should_process(&event));
    }
    
    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_async_processing() {
        let processor = Processor::new();
        let result = processor.process(event).await;
        
        assert!(result.is_ok());
    }
}
```
